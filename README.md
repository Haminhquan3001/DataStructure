# DataStructure

This is the group project where I and my classmates create a program using HashTable, Binary Search Tree (BST), Graph, Linked List data structures to complete a simple program which simply act as a Facebook interface where you will have options to search (by name or intersts), add, view, remove friends.

The program will prompt the user to enter their username and password and the system will check if their loginID is correct. After checking the loginIDs, the system will suggest the user some friends and interests to add and interact with them. 

User will have options such as View their friends lists, Search for new friend that existed in the database, Get friends recommnedation based on their interests, etc.
